## Validator leader

Validator leader receives all transactions, packs them into blocks and propagate them to 2500+ voting validator via Turbine propagation mechanism. 


## Paralelism
Transactions can be executed in a parallel as every Solana transaction is stateless. as a specific transaction doesn't maintain its own state. 

Transaction interracts with accounts that store data. Every transaction read and write different accounts on Solana.  


## Proof of History
Major innovation that allows Solana to be high-performant 


## Summary of Solana network
* Fast confirmation times
* low transaction fees
* executes programs in parallel
* ideal for high-performance applications
